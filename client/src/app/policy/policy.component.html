    <h4>DMCA Takedown Procedure</h4>
    <p><b>Copyright Owner Investigates.</b> A copyright owner should always conduct an initial investigation to confirm both (a) that they own the copyright to an original work and (b) that the content on this site is unauthorized and infringing.</p><br>
    <p><b>Copyright Owner Sends A Notice.</b> After conducting an investigation, a copyright owner prepares and sends a takedown notice to Nasa Pictures. Assuming the takedown notice is sufficiently detailed according to the statutory requirements, we will post the notice along to the affected user.</p><br>
    <p><b>Nasa Pictures Asks User to Make Changes.</b> If the notice alleges that the entire contents of a collection infringe, we will skip to Step 6 and disable the entire collection expeditiously. Otherwise, we will contact the user who created the collection and give them approximately 24 hours to delete or modify the content specified in the notice. We'll notify the copyright owner if and when we give the user a chance to make changes.</p><br>
    <p><b>User Notifies Nasa Pictures of Changes.</b> If the user chooses to make the specified changes, they must tell us so within the approximately 24-hour window. If they don't, we will disable the user. If the user notifies us that they made changes, we will verify that the changes have been made and then notify the copyright owner.</p><br>
    <p><b>Copyright Owner Revises or Retracts the Notice.</b> If the user makes changes, the copyright owner must review them and renew or revise their takedown notice if the changes are insufficient. Nasa Pictures will not take any further action unless the copyright owner contacts us to either renew the original takedown notice or submit a revised one. If the copyright owner is satisfied with the changes, they may either submit a formal retraction or else do nothing. Nasa Pictures will interpret silence longer than two weeks as an implied retraction of the takedown notice.</p><br>
    <p><b>Nasa Pictures May Disable Access to the Content.</b> Nasa Pictures will disable a user's content if: (i) the copyright owner has alleged copyright over the user's entire profile; (ii) the user has not made any changes after being given an opportunity to do so (as noted in Step 4); or (iii) the copyright owner has renewed their takedown notice after the user had a chance to make changes. If the copyright owner chooses instead to revise the notice, we will go back to Step 2 and repeat the process as if the revised notice were a new notice.</p><br>
    <p><b>User May Send A Counter Notice.</b> We encourage users who have had content disabled to consult with a lawyer about their options. If a user believes that their content was disabled as a result of a mistake or misidentification, they may send us a counter notice. As with the original notice, we will make sure that the counter notice is sufficiently detailed. If it is, we will pass the notice back to the copyright owner by sending them the link.</p><br>
    <p><b>Copyright Owner May File a Legal Action.</b> If a copyright owner wishes to keep the content disabled after receiving a counter notice, they will need to initiate a legal action seeking a court order to restrain the user from engaging in infringing activity relating to the content on Nasa Pictures. In other words, you might get sued. If the copyright owner does not give Nasa Pictures notice within 10-14 days, by sending a copy of a valid legal complaint filed in a court of competent jurisdiction, Nasa Pictures will reenable the disabled content.</p><br>
